# Bonkers Visualizer

## About

This is Bryan's native C++ DirectX visualization sandbox for our irrigation data. This will likely
end up being the most fun yet least useful part of this whole project. As we get more data over 
time, I suspect we'll find some pretty useful and telling information, but until then, it's kind of the wild-west 
with this stuff.

## Project Folders

### Inc
Base include folder. Not yet a part of the project (until we have some meaningful source code to add).

### Src
Base Source folder. Only file member is main.cpp at this point.
