# Remote Control Desktop App

## About

This application is meant to be a mechanism for learning how to get different processes to talk to each other
over the network. The main focus of this app will be to set profiles for different "containers" where a "container" 
is the notion of a sensor + water delivery system (as containers can be conceptualized as a whole "planter box" or 
plant pot, itself).

## Intended features

- Configuration of irrigation system by ID (would be great to have some notion of multiple systems being controlled 
   by a single app wizard)
  - Each system will want to have its individual 'containers' to be fine-tuned.
- Quick graph visualization of data history
    - Water throughput over time
    - Temperature
    - Soil readings
    - Number of times watered
    - Water Tank Level
