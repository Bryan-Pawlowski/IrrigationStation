# Practice ProtoBuf
## Wait whaaa....?

Ok so yeah we're going to put some practice stuff in here because I'm a huge noob and I'm not afraid to show it. Yee.
So I'm thinking we could do something really fun but also super lame-o. We're going to make a parking lot data layout
where we've got cars, vans, etc.

## What's to come

I want to create a couple of dummy projects in here. The first manages the cars going into and coming out of the 
lot. We want another application to look at this data and output the status of the parking lot. I am not doing this
because it is ***good design***. I think there are a lot of arguments as to how actually
garbage a deployable solution like this would be, but that's not what this is for. This is for the purposes of my 
embarrassingly and voluntarily public learning endeavors. I don't pretend to know all things. I am simply inviting y'all
along as I try to learn more things.

For reals though I super promise to write about what's up with that proto file.

## Dat Proto

Before we can begin with any development over on this end, we first need to make sure our protobuf library/toolkit is 
installed. To do this go to the [Protobuf](https://github.com/PixelChaserB/IrrigationStation/tree/main/ProtoBuf) page 
follow the instructions in the section titled "Protobuf setup for Windows."

**UPDATE** Just kidding turns out I was using my "jump to conclusions mat." I need to put spaces between those hashes
and the name of the section. ***Egg on myy faaaaaace***.

More laughter. More projects on projects.

## Good night :D

Night got out of hand for me, so will be handling the project setups tomorrow.
